## Project Description:
This project is a part of the Lab 2 assignment for the ITMD 442/542 class. It involves the creation of a contact database application using Node.js Express. The application allows users to perform CRUD operations on individual contacts, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting contacts. The data is persisted using a file system, and the application follows RESTful URL patterns and MVC Structure.

## Insights and Results:
During the development of this project, I gained valuable insights into the process of building a contact database application with Node.js Express. Some of the key takeaways include:

- **Understanding CRUD Operations:** Through implementing create, read, update, and delete functionalities, I deepened my understanding of how to interact with data in a web application.

- **File System Data Persistence:** Working with file system storage for data persistence provided insights into alternative methods of storing application data outside of traditional databases.

- **Handling Form Validation:** Implementing form validation to ensure that required fields are filled and that user input is sanitized helped improve the security and robustness of the application.

- **Challenges Faced:** One of the main challenges encountered during the project was implementing proper error handling and validation for user input. Addressing this challenge required thorough testing and debugging to ensure the application behaved as expected.

- **Results:** Overall, the project was a success, with the application functioning as intended and meeting the requirements outlined in the lab assignment. While there were challenges along the way, overcoming them provided valuable learning opportunities and enhanced my proficiency in web development with Node.js Express.
